# SaaS app in 30 seconds

This repo can be cloned, or  click the `use this template` to create your own repo containing a React app with the 10 odd lines needed to launch a customer dashboard for your SaaS.

## What does `yarn && yarn build` on this repo do?

You can see the final result on https://importsaas-dashboard-demo.onrender.com/ which is hosted on Render

## What does setting `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` env on this repo do? 

if you want to allow google based login, Set the `.env` 

    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com

Once deployed with this env, (and your domain set in Google), your users will need to authenticate to access the private pages.

# How it works?

In other words, with this package in your React app - a few lines of code automagically adds the following pages to your React app

- /settings
- /apikeys
- /team
- /login
- /logout
- /tour (WIP)
- /forums (WIP)

## Why use this package

If you have built or are building a SaaS - you know that 75% of the features involve rudimentary things like account management, billing, settings, and these api keys, forums, and documentation.

This package bundles all these features in an opiniated fashion much like how you would see on `platform.openai.com`

**WIP**

- /docs
- /help
- /register
- /billing
